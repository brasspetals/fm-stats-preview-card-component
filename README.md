## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Keyframe Animations

### What I learned

First time implementing:

- [mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) in combo with `opacity` to match the header image design
- [prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) to prevent the animations from playing for those who prefer reduced motion

### Useful resources
